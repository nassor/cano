//! # Storage API - Share Data Between Workflow Nodes
//!
//! This module provides simple, thread-safe storage for sharing data between nodes in workflows.
//! Think of it as a shared key-value store that any node can read from and write to.
//!
//! ## üéØ Why Storage?
//!
//! In workflows, nodes often need to pass data to each other:
//! - A data loader puts results for a processor to use
//! - A validator stores validation results for an auditor
//! - A processor saves intermediate results for a reporter
//!
//! Storage makes this communication simple and type-safe.
//!
//! ## üöÄ Quick Start
//!
//! Use `MemoryStore` to store different types of data using key-value pairs.
//! Store data with `put()` and retrieve it later with `get()` - the storage
//! handles type safety automatically through generic methods.
//!
//! ## üîß How It Works
//!
//! ### Stack and Heap Values
//!
//! The storage system can accept both stack-based and heap-based values.
//! It's the user's responsibility to decide whether to use Copy-on-Write (Cow)
//! or direct value storage based on their performance requirements.
//!
//! ### Type Safety with Any
//!
//! Storage uses `Box<dyn Any>` internally but provides type-safe access.
//! When you request data with the correct type, it returns `Some(value)`.
//! When the type doesn't match, it safely returns `None`.
//!
//! ## üèóÔ∏è Using Storage in Nodes
//!
//! In your custom nodes, use storage to read input data in the `prep()` phase,
//! process it in `exec()`, and store results in the `post()` phase for the next node.
//!
//! ## üîß Available Storage Types
//!
//! ### MemoryStore (Default)
//!
//! A thread-safe, in-memory HashMap-based storage that's ready to use out of the box.
//! Perfect for most workflows where data fits in memory.
//!
//! ### Custom Storage
//!
//! Implement the [`StoreTrait`] trait for custom backends like databases,
//! file systems, or network storage. The trait requires implementing
//! `get`, `put`, `remove`, `append`, `delete`, `keys`, `len`, and `clear` methods.
//!
//! ## üí° Best Practices
//!
//! ### Key Naming
//!
//! Use consistent, descriptive key names throughout your workflow.
//! Good keys are clear about what data they contain (e.g., "user_profile",
//! "validation_errors", "processing_status").
//!
//! ### Memory Management
//!
//! - Choose between stack and heap allocation based on data size and lifetime
//! - Use Copy-on-Write (Cow) when you need memory efficiency
//! - Clear storage when workflows complete to free memory
//!
//! ### Error Handling
//!
//! Always handle missing keys gracefully by providing sensible defaults.
//! Use the `unwrap_or()` pattern to provide fallback values when data
//! might not be present in storage.

/// Core storage trait for workflow data sharing
///
/// This trait defines the interface for storage backends used in Cano workflows.
/// It provides a simple key-value store that any node can read from and write to.
///
/// ## üéØ Purpose
///
/// The `StoreTrait` enables different storage backends while keeping the same API:
/// - [`MemoryStore`]: Fast in-memory storage (default)
/// - File-based storage: For persistent workflows
/// - Database storage: For enterprise workflows
/// - Network storage: For distributed workflows
///
/// ## üîß Type Safety
///
/// The storage system uses type erasure with `Box<dyn Any>` internally but provides
/// type-safe access through generic methods. Store data with automatic type inference
/// and retrieve with explicit type annotation for safety.
///
/// ## üîí Thread Safety Requirements
///
/// All `StoreTrait` implementations are always thread-safe (`Send + Sync`) to support
/// concurrent access from async tasks. This typically means using interior mutability
/// patterns like `Arc<Mutex<_>>` or `Arc<RwLock<_>>`.
///
/// ## üöÄ Implementation Example
///
/// A simple thread-safe storage implementation using `Arc<RwLock<HashMap>>`.
/// Custom storage backends can implement the StoreTrait to provide
/// persistence, distribution, or other specialized functionality.
///
/// ## üìã Method Overview
///
/// | Method | Purpose | Example |
/// |--------|---------|---------|
/// | `get` | Retrieve a value | `let val: Result<T, StoreError> = storage.get("key")` |
/// | `put` | Store a value | `storage.put("key", value)?` |
/// | `remove` | Delete a key | `storage.remove("key")?` |
/// | `append` | Append to existing value | `storage.append("key", item)?` |
/// | `delete` | Alias for remove | `storage.delete("key")?` |
/// | `keys` | Get all keys | `for key in storage.keys()? { ... }` |
/// | `len` | Get count of items | `let count = storage.len()?` |
/// | `clear` | Remove all data | `storage.clear()?` |
///
/// ## Type Safety
///
/// The storage system uses type erasure with `Box<dyn Any + Send + Sync>` to allow
/// storing arbitrary types. Users must handle type safety through downcasting.
///
/// ## Implementation Requirements
///
/// All methods must be implemented to provide complete storage functionality.
/// The trait provides no default implementations to ensure optimal performance
/// for different storage backends.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// All implementations are guaranteed to be thread-safe (`Send + Sync`).
/// For mutable operations, this typically means using interior mutability patterns
/// or external synchronization.
